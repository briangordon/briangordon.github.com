*Disclaimer: I am not a registered investment advisor and I'm not licensed to give financial advice. This is simply an educational resource intended to spread basic investment literacy. It's generally a good idea to be skeptical of investing advice offered by non-[fiduciaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary) **like me** because they may be trying to sell you something.*

## Why bother with investments?

The last triennial [Survey of Consumer Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf17.pdf) found that only 51.9% of American families owned stocks, either directly or indirectly through pensions or mutual funds. This is a shame because the stock market offers access to attractive returns with relatively low risk. For many people, it may be the difference between being able to retire comfortably and having no realistic retirement plan at all. 

Don't underestimate the power of compound growth. The chart below shows the growth of three different theoretical portfolios. In **green** we have Andy, who puts $100 under his mattress each month. In **blue** we have Arnold, who deposits $100 each month into a Bank of America savings account, which yields [0.03% APY](https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/savings/savings-accounts/). And in **red** we have Ann, who puts $100 each month into a diversified stock/bond portfolio which returns, [let's](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/classic-60-40/) [say](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/performance/vbiax), 6% per year.

Notice that, even over 10 years, today's low interest rates mean that Andy and Arnold's portfolios are practically indistinguishable. However, Ann has about $4,000 more than the others! You can download the spreadsheet [here](images/growth.xlsx) if you want to play with the model yourself.

## Why manage your own investments?

In a word: **fees**. A traditional financial advisor will want to take around 1% of your assets every year to manage your portfolio. So-called "robo advisor" services like [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/) and [Betterment](http://www.betterment.com/) will charge a fraction of this but their fees still add up when you take into account the effect of compounding. The below chart ([model](images/growth-fees.xlsx)) shows the growth of $100,000 at 6% per year over 30 years, and then the same growth accounting for monthly advisor fees at 0.25% and 1% per year.

At the end of 30 years, the self-managed portfolio has almost $150,000 more than the traditionally-managed portfolio! Of course, this assumes that your investments are just as successful without the help of an advisor. This
